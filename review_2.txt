Editor's and Reviewers' comments:    

Reviewer #2: In the paper, the authors present the application of the Plucker coordinates to compute the intersection of object of different dimensions. The core of the algorithm is the 1d-2d intersection. The other cases consider a suitable decomposition to fall back to the 1d-2d case. Special and degenerate cases are taken into account.                                                                            
                                                                                             
I found that the article investigates a topic of substantial interest for the Computers and Mathematics with Applications audiences. However due to its level of technicality I strongly suggest to increase the number of illustrative figures. I found the test cases very interesting.                                                      

Comments:                                                                                              
- is the algorithm suited only for simplicial meshes? If so, please specify from the very beginning (maybe in the title) otherwise explain how can be generalized.                                                                                  
- in the introduction please explain the different nature of the fractures
- in the introduction when citing [2] you don't use the initial of the names, but you do few lines below for [15]. Please unify this notation.                              
- page 3. Please rephrase or make it more clear the second point of the list                
- page 3. u_p and v_p are not defined                  
- page 3. I suggest to write a paragraph to introduce and highlight all the relevant properties of the Plucker coordinates. Introduce also few references for the people not used to Plucker coordinates.                                                
- page 4. Please discuss the sign of the permuted inner product if the intersection occurs at the boundary (vertex and edge)                                          
- lemma 2.1. Please make more clear how to derive (2)
- page 5, point 3. The parameter epsilon is not defined.
- page 5, please provide some pictures for the intersection algorithm, in particular for the "critical cases"                                                            
- page 10 and 11. Please add some figure to visualize, in particular, the degenerate cases
- is it possible to highlight, in Fig 8, the regions which requires more computational time? Maybe with some figure zoom are relative discussion                        
- is it possible to have in the appendix the source code, using the Flow123d library, to perform a simple example with the proposed algorithm? Eg the one from Fig 6. If this is not possible maybe a link to a web page with such example.                                                                                      
- please check reference [7] and [16]. Some of the references are incomplete (eg page number for [6] and [7])

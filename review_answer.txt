Reviewer1:
- It is not quite clear what is the main motivation for this work. Why to use FE computation
on non-matching grids? It is clear that the mesh generation is easier but on the other hand
the FE solution is much more complicated. There exist mesh generation codes allowing to
generate matching grids for complicated geometries. This item should be discussed.

- The authors should outline how the algorithm is sensitive to the computer arithmetic.
Namely, how to set parameter  in the algorithm in page 5? Is it necessary to choose it
empirically or is there a more sophisticated approach?

- I suppose that it would be also nice to add some FE solution of the considered problem on
meshes from Figure 8.

- bottom of page 3: what is u p and v p ? What is their relation to v?
Notation explained better.
PE done

- I do not understand too much to Figure 1. There is stated that ‚Äúthe sign of the permuted
inner product gives us the relative position of the two lines‚Äù. But in Figure 1, there is more
lines. Which two of them are considered?
Explained better with link to the notation used above.
PE done

- Section 4.2: Table 1 shows that the algorithms based on the Pl√ºcker coordinates is less
effective. Are there some another advantages of this algorithm?


Reviewer2:
- is the algorithm suited only for simplicial meshes? If so, please specify from the very beginning (maybe in the title) otherwise explain how can be generalized.                                                                                  
- in the introduction please explain the different nature of the fractures
- in the introduction when citing [2] you don't use the initial of the names, but you do few lines below for [15]. Please unify this notation.                              
- page 3. Please rephrase or make it more clear the second point of the list                
- page 3. u_p and v_p are not defined                  
  PE done
- page 3. I suggest to write a paragraph to introduce and highlight all the relevant properties of the Plucker coordinates. Introduce also few references for the people not used to Plucker coordinates.                                                
- page 4. Please discuss the sign of the permuted inner product if the intersection occurs at the boundary (vertex and edge)                                          
PE done. Explained better with link to the notation used above. Figure 1 case b improved.
- lemma 2.1. Please make more clear how to derive (2)
- page 5, point 3. The parameter epsilon is not defined.
- page 5, please provide some pictures for the intersection algorithm, in particular for the "critical cases"                                                            
- page 10 and 11. Please add some figure to visualize, in particular, the degenerate cases
- is it possible to highlight, in Fig 8, the regions which requires more computational time? Maybe with some figure zoom are relative discussion                        
- is it possible to have in the appendix the source code, using the Flow123d library, to perform a simple example with the proposed algorithm? Eg the one from Fig 6. If this is not possible maybe a link to a web page with such example.                                                                                      

- please check reference [7] and [16]. Some of the references are incomplete (eg page number for [6] and [7])
PE: [6] - fixed pages
    [7] - pages are not available, there is a weird problem: if I add pages (pages={1--23}) then also the year will appear, otherwise it is without year.
    [16] I can't see any problem with this reference, it is complete and link works..

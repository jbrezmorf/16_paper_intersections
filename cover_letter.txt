Dear editors José Luis Galán-García and Gabriel Aguilera-Venegas,

We wish to submit a new manuscript entitled 
“Fast Algorithms for Intersection of Non-matching Grids Using Plucker Coordinates.” 
for possible publication in "Computers & Mathematics with Applications" journal in special issue ESCO 2016.
We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor it is currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The XFEM, Mortar methods, and Nitche's methods attract popularity as they are able to deal with complex or 
varying domains. The technical issues of the mesh intersection problems however prevent their widespread.
The paper presents a family of algorithms for intersections of simplicial elements of different dimension
using Plucker coordinates. These algorithms combined with an advancing front technique allow reuse of
calculations by neighbouring elements reducing number of algebraic operations.

This work significantly extends the algorithm for ray-tetrahedron intersection due to Platis and Theoharis.
In particular, the triangle-tetrahedron algorithm is presented and and detection of spacial intersection cases
is discussed. Further, these algorithms are combined with the advancing front method into a mesh intersection algorithm.
Finally, three variants of the mesh intersection algorithm are compared on both academic and realistic meshes.
